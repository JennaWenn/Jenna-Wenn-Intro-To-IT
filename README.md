My name is Jenna Wenn my email is jennawenn7@gmail.com and my student number is s3816643. My nationality is Australian, British and Irish. My culture is Australian. I have completed year 12 and was awarded my Western Certificate of Education, I also have a Certificate II in Sampling & Measurement and my Certificate III in Business Administration. I have very basic language knowledge of Indonesian and Japanese. I love anime, gaming and almost every fantasy movie ever from Harry Potter to Lord of The Rings. I moved from Perth to Brisbane and have been to Japan once but would like to go back next year for the 2020 Olympics. I also do recreational shooting at a range though I’m not good.

**Interest in IT:**
My interest in IT has always been at a young age. I've always been fascinated by machinery lines and the robots that put cars together or even the robots we have now that are sort of like a pet or companion, vector would be a good example of this. At a very young age I can also remember my dad playing all the classic PS1 games like Spyro, Abe's Oddworld Oddessy and Crash Bandicoot, while my love for games and anime has stuck throughout the years my fascination in the way we make things wasn’t very much in my life until I met my current boyfriend who has got me interested in IT again.

**Why I chose RMIT:**
I chose to go to RMIT as the courses on OUA looked extensive and as if they cover a lot in IT. I work and my roster is always changing so that's why I RMIT through OUA. It makes it a lot easier for me to study and not have any work hours taken away, so it's the best of both worlds for me. Another reason why I chose RMIT is for programming the course looks extensive but yet easy to understand as they explain to me and other students.

**Why I chose RMIT:**
Through my studies at RMIT even though being online I expect to learn and contribute as much as someone on campus, I expect it to further my time management skills, I expect to learn everything IT. For example, what's new, ways that it is affecting the modern day world and IT ideas that aren't so good. I also expect to learn how to further my coding knowledge and complete both courses.

This position is an entry level position for assisting in making a “Data Management System”. This role also means that I would be able to further my software making skills once finished at RMIT. The product is ever-changing and the company (Moonwalk) also award you with ownership of substantial products once you complete others. This position also offers career development and room for growth, due to the nature of being able to work on multiple aspects of the software suite you would be able to expand your knowledge in various aspects of software development, such as programming languages/database design. This interests me as id be able to improve my programming abilities and knowledge in programming as well as furthering my career path. The requirements are not extensive for this job however they are hard to achieve meaning not just anybody can apply for the job and get it, you are required to have knowledge in computer science or a degree, excellent written and verbal skills not just over the phone or to coworkers but in the important emails you send and you must also have proficiency in Java, C or C++ which means that this would eliminate any errors or bugs that might occur if someone without this knowledge that is required got this position. As it currently is I have expert level written and verbal skills, while this is indeed one of the requirements of this job I don’t currently have the other two. My plan to achieve the other two requirements is to complete my study at RMIT and learn the wacky and temperamental language that is programming. As for my written and verbal i hope to better it, while typos are inevitable I’d like to reduce them dramatically and I believe working on assignments will help me.

**Online test results:**
* ***Results from Myers-Briggs test:***
1. ENFJ-Very good match
2. INFJ-Very good match
3. ESFJ-Good match
* ***Results of learning style test:***
1. Auditory 40%
2. Visual 35%
3. Tactile 25%
* ***Results of creativity test:***
1. 65.53
this test helped me by highlighting the key points of my personality being compassionate, learning better with auditory aids and with these strengths I should aim to do more group work and have a level of understanding when someone can not make it one night, my auditory learning style will also be valuable for online study and participating in an online group as it means I will take on information better. I should take these strengths and use them to my benefit, if I fall behind on a group project I can get the aspects explained to me by another team member and still be able to understand what they are completing and as for my compassionate side I would be able to return the favour. As for the creativity test I have the ability to carry large quantities of information which means I would be able to absorb what needs to be done and discuss it with my team.

**Project idea:**
My project idea is a smartphone app. In this app you would be able to choose your favorite character from Dragon Maid. This will have the original voice acting, in dub or sub and will have many more features that will be discussed further. The project will require Java and C++ for the programming. People will be able to apply for the beta testing in the early stages of development and then as the code is more refined it will be released to the general public on Android and IOS. The app will have a free version and a $5 version. 

My motivation for this project is my love for anime. A Lot of apps similar have been created in Japan but never catered towards westerners. These apps are only available in Japanese or even region locked, which is why I came up with the idea to make a western version. With major streaming service AnimeLab which is owned by Australian company Madman Entertainment it shows that westerners are overdue for an app like this, AnimeLab has 1 Million users spread across Australia and New Zealand, meaning that a lot of people would value an app like this and even pay for it.

This app will have the original voice actors and the main and secondary characters on file to use. To get all the characters on file the consumer will need to pay but it will also come with extras with the pay version. In the pay version more dialog options, clothes options including pajamas and character options. With the free version only select characters will be available and no option for more dialog or clothes. You will also have the option to set a background of your choice. When you open the app you will be greeted by the character you have set. In this app in both versions you will be able to set alarms it will also have the time built into the app and a clock which allows you to set your alarms , get weather updates, plan commutes from point a to point b and vise versa, talk to the characters, get them to search the web and have personalised messages when you wake up and go to bed. You will be able to set your name and what you’d like after it (chan, senpai) etc. The service will be available only to Australia and New Zealand with eventually the option to expand. The app will have options for Japanese with no subtitles for people who are proficient in Japanese, a subtitled version for people who prefer the Japanese voice acting and an English version for people who like the dub voice acting. Some potential drawbacks in this area is getting the permission to use the characters and voice actors.

For this app to run correctly the tools and technologies I will be using will be, a working updated phone for the app to run on, a search engine like google when you ask the character to search the web, for when the weather report is given it will take a live feed from Google or the Bureau of Meteorology and give you the results, for commutes it will have a map in the app run by google and will display multiple route options, this app will be coded with Java and to code the whole app you will need a computer/laptop and a working phone to ensure the coding and app are both working fine. Some drawbacks from this aspect is getting the google aspects to integrate correctly with the app.

The skills required for my project is very strong proficiency in reading and writing skills, possibly someone with advanced knowledge in Japanese, proficiency in java is a must, a degree in programming, basic knowledge of how a phone works and how google search engines work and how google maps work. Some of these will be easy to fill but others not so much. The strong proficiency in reading and writing, knowledge on phones and how google operates will be easy to fill but the ones that will be harder than others will be: advanced in the language Japanese. Being from a westeren country, not a lot of people will know Japanese but as my app offers a Japanese version as well, it is a necessity to have someone on the team who can speak and understand Japanese. Proficiency in Java and the degree tie together without these two components it is possible that the app will not run as smoothly as it should.

If this project is successful I would have created an app that has every important aspect of our daily life with a character that makes us laugh and happy in general. The problems would have been solved by having a great team of coders and getting permission to use the characters meaning that the problems will be solved.This app would bring a new contender to the market in the app store with it utilising characters from a well known anime with it also offering a free and a “pay to play” version for cheap, a lot of people will find it useful and convenient with the added features that people use on an almost daily basis like maps and weather.
